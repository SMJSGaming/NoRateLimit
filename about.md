# No Rate Limit

Prevent rate limiting by stuttering requests. This only works on Robtop's endpoints.

## Features
- Prevents rate limiting by stuttering requests to ensure no more than 90 requests (default) per minute are made.
- Configurable request limit (anywhere from 10 - 99 requests per minute, defaults to 90)

## Incompatibilities
- This mod is incompatible with GDIntercept, as it hooks the same functions. This will be fixed in a future Geode update.
